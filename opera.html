            Good evening.  Fancy ball?
        </p>
        <h5 class="name">GIU.</h5>
        <p class="giuseppe">
            No, not exactly.  A little friendly dance.  That's all.  Sorry you're late.
        </p>

        <p class="don">
             But I saw a groom dancing, and a footman!
        </p>
        <h5 class="name">MAR.</h5>
        <p class="marco">
            Yes.  That's the Lord High Footman.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name">DON AL.</h5>
        <p class="don">
            And, dear me, a common little drummer boy!
       </p>
       <h5 class="name">GIU.</h5>
       <p class="giuseppe">
            Oh no!  That's the Lord High Drummer Boy.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name">DON AL.</h5>
       <p class="don">
              But surely, surely the servants'-hall is the place for these gentry?
        </p>
        <h5 class="name">GIU.</h5>
        <p class="giuseppe">
              Oh dear no!  We have appropriated the servants'-hall. It's the Royal Apartment, and accessible only by tickets obtainable at the Lord Chamberlain's office.
        </p>
        <h5 class="name">MAR.</h5>
        <p class="marco">
              We really must have some place that we can call our own.
