            DON AL.  Good evening.  Fancy ball?
        </p>
        <p>
            GIU.  No, not exactly.  A little friendly dance.  That's all.  Sorry you're late.
        </p>
        <p>
           DON AL.  But I saw a groom dancing, and a footman!
        </p>
        <p>
            MAR.  Yes.  That's the Lord High Footman.
        </p>
        <p>
            DON AL.  And, dear me, a common little drummer boy!
       </p>
       <p>
            GIU.  Oh no!  That's the Lord High Drummer Boy.
        </p>
       <p>
            DON AL.  But surely, surely the servants'-hall is the place for these gentry?
        </p>
        <p>
            GIU.  Oh dear no!  We have appropriated the servants'-hall. It's the Royal Apartment, and accessible only by tickets obtainable at the Lord Chamberlain's office.
        </p>
        <p>
            MAR.  We really must have some place that we can call our own.
